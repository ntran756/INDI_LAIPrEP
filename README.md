# Reproducible code for: Intersectional discrimination and preferences for long-acting injectable HIV PrEP

This repository contains all code used to conduct the analyses and generate the results for the study examining how intersectional discrimination is associated with LAI PrEP preferences among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men in Philadelphia, PA. 

Data for this code is not publicly available due the sensitive nature of the data.

The code is written in R version 4.5.1, and we use `renv` to facilitate reproducibility. Primary packages required for analysis are `tidyverse` (version 2.0.0), `here` (1.0.1), `marginaleffects` (0.27.0), and `tableone` (0.13.2). 

Status: The manuscript based on this analysis is currently under peer review at _Sexuality Research and Social Policy_. This README will be updated with a DOI and citation once it is published.
